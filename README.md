# HDLC-Framer
The High Level Link Control (HDLC) protocol defined by the International Standards Organisation (ISO) provides a transparent transmission service at the data link layer of the OSI reference model. Many protocol suites use an HDLC (or HDLC-based) link layer, including X.25, the IP point-to-point protocol (PPP) and SNA.  The users of the HDLC service provides PDUs which are encapsulated to form data link layer frames. These frames are separated by HDLC "flags" and are modified by "zero bit insertion" to guarantee transparency.
